## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **C structures** to represent and manipulate complex numbers.  
Two implementations are included:

- **Direct structure usage** (pass-by-value)
- **Indirect structure usage** using pointers and dynamic memory allocation

Both approaches compute the sum of two complex numbers and print the result along with a timestamp.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- User-defined `struct` data types
- Passing structures to functions
- Returning structures from functions
- Pointer-based structure access (`->`)
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`)
- Modular function design
- Time and date output using `time.h`

## Files
- `main 7.c` – Direct structure-based complex number addition
- `main 7.2.c` – Pointer-based (indirect) complex number addition
- `Code+Output-1.jpg` – Program output (direct method)
- `Code+Output-2.jpg` – Program output (pointer method)
